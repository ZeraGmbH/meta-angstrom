# Use this at your own risk, we welcome bugreports sent to

# Again, in doubt, use the master branch of setup-scripts

# will RRECOMMEND as much as possible content for a given language
# (locales, UI transalations, help, etc. - useless for pros, but really 
# helpful for common users).
# Also, it appears that no locales fit in 16Mb for now. "C" locale rules!
